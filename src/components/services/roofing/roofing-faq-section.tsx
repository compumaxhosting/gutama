     question: "How do I know if my roof needs repair or replacement?",
     answer:
       "Signs such as recurring leaks, missing or damaged shingles, sagging areas, water stains, or an aging roof may indicate that professional attention is needed. A roof inspection can help determine whether a repair is sufficient or a replacement makes more sense.",
   },
   {
     question: "How quickly can a roofing problem be repaired?",
     answer:
       "The timeframe depends on the type and extent of the damage. Minor leaks or damaged shingles may be repaired relatively quickly, while larger or storm-related issues may require a more detailed inspection and repair plan.",
   },
   {
     question: "Do you provide roofing services for commercial properties?",
     answer:
       "Yes. Gutama Home Improvement provides roofing services for both residential and commercial properties, including flat roofing systems such as EPDM and TPO.",
   },
   {
     question: "What types of roofing systems do you work with?",
     answer:
       "Our roofing services include asphalt shingle roofing, flat roofing, EPDM, TPO, and slate roofing. We can recommend a suitable option based on your property's structure, existing roof, and project requirements.",
   },
   {
     question: "Can you repair a slate roof instead of replacing it?",
     answer:
       "In many cases, damaged slate roofing can be repaired without replacing the entire roof. The appropriate approach depends on the condition of the slate, flashing, underlayment, and surrounding roofing materials.",
   },
   {
     question: "What happens during a roof tear-off?",
     answer:
       "During a roof tear-off, the existing roofing materials are carefully removed so the underlying roof deck can be inspected. Any damaged areas can then be addressed before the new roofing system is installed.",
   },
   {
     question: "How can I tell if a roof leak is getting worse?",
     answer:
       "Water stains on ceilings or walls, damp insulation, peeling paint, mold growth, or repeated leaks are signs that moisture may be entering the structure. Even a small visible leak can indicate a larger roofing issue.",
   },
   {
     question: "Do you offer emergency roof repairs in Essex County?",
     answer:
       "Yes. If your property has sudden roof damage from severe weather, fallen branches, or an unexpected leak, contact Gutama Home Improvement to discuss the damage and available repair options.",
   },
   {
     question: "How long does a roof replacement usually take?",
     answer:
       "Project duration varies based on the roof's size, materials, complexity, weather conditions, and the condition of the existing roof deck. Your roofing contractor can provide a more accurate timeline after an inspection.",
   },
   {
     question: "Do you provide free roofing estimates?",
     answer:
       "Yes. Gutama Home Improvement offers free roof inspections and estimates to help property owners understand the condition of their roof and the work that may be required.",
   },
   {
     question: "Do you provide roofing services throughout Essex County, NJ?",
     answer:
       "Yes. Gutama Home Improvement serves homeowners and businesses throughout Essex County, including Newark, Montclair, West Orange, Bloomfield, Livingston, Maplewood, Orange, East Orange, and surrounding communities.",
   },
   {
     question: "What should I do if my roof is damaged after a storm?",
     answer:
       "If you notice missing shingles, exposed areas, leaks, or other storm damage, contact a roofing professional for an inspection. If possible, document the visible damage with photos, but avoid walking on or attempting to repair the roof yourself.",
   },
