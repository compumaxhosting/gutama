      {
        q: "What is re-roofing?",
        a: "Re-roofing is the process of installing a new roofing system over an existing roof or replacing worn roofing materials to restore protection, improve performance, and extend the life of the roof.",
      },
      {
        q: "How much does re-roofing cost in Newark NJ?",
        a: "Most re-roofing projects in Newark range from approximately $4,000 to $25,000 depending on roof size, material selection, labor requirements, accessibility, and any repairs required during the project.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is re-roofing cheaper than replacing a roof?",
        a: "Yes. Re-roofing is often less expensive than a complete roof replacement because it may require less labor and material removal. However, eligibility depends on the condition of the existing roof and local code requirements.",
      },
      {
        q: "How long does re-roofing take?",
        a: "Most residential re-roofing projects take between one and five days depending on roof size, weather conditions, roofing materials, and overall project complexity.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can you re-roof over existing shingles?",
        a: "In some cases, yes. New Jersey building codes generally allow limited roofing layers if the roof structure is sound and other requirements are met. A professional inspection is necessary to determine eligibility.",
      },
      {
        q: "When should you re-roof your house?",
        a: "You should consider re-roofing when your roof shows signs of aging, repeated leaks, damaged shingles, granule loss, or declining performance while still maintaining a structurally sound roof deck.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do I need a permit for re-roofing in Newark NJ?",
        a: "Permit requirements vary depending on project scope, structural changes, and local regulations. A licensed roofing contractor can help determine permit requirements for your specific property.",
      },
      {
        q: "How many layers of shingles are allowed in New Jersey?",
        a: "Building code requirements may limit the number of roofing layers allowed. Most roofing professionals recommend a full inspection to ensure compliance with current New Jersey regulations before proceeding with re-roofing.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is re-roofing worth it?",
        a: "Yes. Re-roofing can be a cost-effective investment that improves weather protection, enhances curb appeal, increases property value, and extends the life of your roofing system when the existing structure remains in good condition.",
