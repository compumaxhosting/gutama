      question: "What is roof removal?",
      answer:
        "Roof removal is the process of completely removing existing roofing materials before installing a new roof. This allows contractors to inspect the roof deck, identify hidden damage, and ensure proper installation.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does roof removal take?",
      answer:
        "Most residential roof removal projects can be completed within one to two days. Larger or more complex roofs may require additional time.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is roof removal better than a roof overlay?",
      answer:
        "In many cases, yes. Roof removal allows for structural inspection, hidden damage detection, and proper installation of new roofing materials, which often leads to a longer-lasting roof.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much does roof removal cost in Essex County, NJ?",
      answer:
        "Roof removal costs vary based on roof size, material type, accessibility, and whether repairs are needed. A professional inspection is the best way to receive an accurate estimate.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Can damaged roof decking be replaced during roof removal?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Any damaged or rotted decking discovered during the tear-off process can be repaired or replaced before the new roof is installed.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does homeowners insurance cover roof removal?",
      answer:
        "Insurance may cover roof removal when damage is caused by a covered event such as hail, wind, or severe storms. Coverage depends on the terms of your policy.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know if I need a roof inspection?",
      answer:
        "If your roof is more than 20 years old, has visible damage, leaks, or storm-related issues, scheduling a professional inspection is recommended.",
    },
