      question:
        "What is the difference between re-roofing and roof replacement?",
      answer:
        "Re-roofing refers to installing a new roofing system over or in place of an existing roof, while roof replacement often involves removing old materials and replacing the entire roofing structure when necessary.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a re-roofing project take?",
      answer:
        "Most residential re-roofing projects are completed within a few days, depending on roof size, weather conditions, and project complexity.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know if I need re-roofing?",
      answer:
        "Signs include roof leaks, damaged shingles, sagging areas, moisture problems, and an aging roof nearing the end of its lifespan.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the average lifespan of a new roof?",
      answer:
        "The lifespan depends on the roofing material. Asphalt shingles can last 20 to 30 years, while metal roofing systems may last 40 years or longer.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does homeowners insurance cover re-roofing?",
      answer:
        "Insurance coverage depends on the cause of damage and the terms of your policy. Storm-related damage may be covered under many policies.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can re-roofing improve energy efficiency?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Modern roofing materials and improved ventilation systems can help reduce energy consumption and improve indoor comfort.",
